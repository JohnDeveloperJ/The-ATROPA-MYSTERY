# Automatic Token Peg (ATP) Project

## Overview

The Automatic Token Peg (ATP) project is a decentralized system for maintaining the peg of the ATP Token to a target value, achieved through a buyback mechanism involving pDAI tokens. This README provides an overview of the project, how it works, and how to set up and use it.

## Project Description

The ATP project consists of two main smart contracts: the ATP Token contract and the pDAI (Pegged DAI) contract. Together, they maintain a stable peg for the ATP Token by performing buyback operations when the token's market price falls below a specified target value.

## How It Works

The ATP Token maintains its peg through the following process:

1. The ATP Token contract defines a `targetValue` representing the desired pegged value.

2. External systems or oracles monitor the ATP Token's market price.

3. When the market price falls below the `targetValue`, a buyback operation is triggered.

4. During the buyback operation, pDAI tokens are used to purchase ATP Tokens, which are subsequently burned, reducing the total supply.

5. This process helps stabilize the ATP Token's price, bringing it closer to the target value.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   gh repo clone JohnDeveloperJ/The-ATROPA-MYSTERY
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Initialize Hardhat and install dependencies:
   ````shell
   npx hardhat
   yarn install
   ```npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
   npm i @chainlink/contracts
   ````

## Usage

- **Developing Smart Contracts**: Write your Solidity smart contracts in the `contracts/` directory. You can use any code editor or IDE.

- **Compiling Smart Contracts**: Compile your smart contracts using Hardhat:

  ```shell
  npx hardhat compile
  ```

- **Testing**: Write and run tests for your smart contracts using Hardhat's testing framework:
  ```shell
  npx hardhat test
  ```
